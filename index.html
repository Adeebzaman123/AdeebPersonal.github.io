                <p>Hi, my name is Adeeb Zaman. I am a student who has graduated from secondary school. And am now looking for work while learning about programming and coding. I am trying to get into the field of IT and software and Bright Network is where I have started. As a 17 year old, I am trying to build on my skills and try out new things. Other than IT and technology hobbies that I indulge in is chess. I love the strategic thinking the game involves and how hard it is. I do sports like table tennis and boxing as they are very technical and cause me to tire out, they are very exhuasting btw, so be careful.</p>

            <p> I am 17 years old, and am currently living in London. I was born and raised in London in a very well and good communinity. I was born and raised as a Muslim. This religion definetly paved the man I am today and I hold it very close to my heart. I went to an islamic boarding school, where I done GCSE'S and memorised the whole Quran - this is a very hard and important status to achieve in Islam. And now I am looking for work in IT as it is a field I really like. It's not a very unique story but one where I will continue to improve on. Sorry if you expected me to be a hero or something hahaha!</p>
